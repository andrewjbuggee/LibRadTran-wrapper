# LibRadTran-wrapper
This repository will keep track of Matlab files used to run LibRadTran from the command line. 
Matlab will write uvspec files, run them from the command line, and then save subsequent data in useful formats for Matlab to post-process.
All work is performed by Andrew John Buggee
