%% --- Read Output Files from UVSPEC ---
% ======================================
% The purpose of this script is to run uvspec with the inputs specfied in
% by the user. The user will be required to specify the atmospheric
% composition, RTE solver, wavelength range, wavelength resolution, aerosol
% content, cloud content, and solar spectrum. This file will then be fed
% into the command line to run uvspec.
